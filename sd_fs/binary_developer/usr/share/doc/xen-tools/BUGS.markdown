Reporting Bugs
==============

To report a bug please use the [xen-tools-discuss* mailing
list](http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-tools/lists.html).

If you're capable of fixing it yourself a patch is appreciated, and a
test case would be a useful bonus.


Known Bugs
==========

The Debian bug tracker contains a [list of all currently open
issues](http://bugs.debian.org/xen-tools) which have been reported by
the users of the Debian package (the primary user-base).

If you're running the code on a Debian host system then reporting bugs
against this package is a good thing to do; by doing so you allow
others to view issues, and I check the bug-page regularly.
