Mailing List
============

For assistance on using, or customising, these scripts please consult
the manpages initially, then the
[website](http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-tools/).

If these are not sufficient resources please consider posting any
queries you might have to the [mailing
list](http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-tools/lists.html)

Included with the release you should find the file `BUGS.markdown`
which contains some notes on reporting bugs.


Xen Queries
===========

If your query is mostly related to Xen, rather than these tools, then
please consider joining the [xen-users mailing
list](http://lists.xensource.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/xen-users)

The members of that list are very good at diagnosing issues with
networking, block devices, and other Xen oddities.

There's also the IRC channel `##xen` (the double hashmark is not a
 typo) on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC network.


Contact The Author
==================

As a last resort you can to contact the current maintainer, Axel
Beckert, at <abe@deuxchevaux.org>.

As the previous xen-tools maintainer and original author, Steve
Kemp, said, I say last resort not because I'm unwilling to help, but
because it may take longer for me to respond to you personally.
