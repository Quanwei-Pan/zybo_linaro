Xen for Debian
==============

Config behaviour
----------------

The Debian packages changes the behaviour of some config options.

The options "kernel", "initrd" and "loader" searches in the Xen private boot
directory (/usr/lib/xen-$version/boot) first. "bootloader" and "device_model"
also searches the Xen private bin directory (/usr/lib/xen-$version/bin). This
means that the following entries will properly find anything:
  loader = 'hvmloader'
  bootloader = 'pygrub'

Network setup
-------------

The Debian package of Xen don't change the network setup in any way.  This
differs from the upstream version, which overwrites the main network card
(eth0) with a bridge setup and may break the network at this point..

To setup a bridge please follow the instructions in the manpage for
bridge-utils-interfaces(5).

You can also change the /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp file and re-enable the Xen
included network setup by adding
  (network-script network-bridge)
to the file. But please note that this may or may not work.
