LTTNG LIVE
----------

This is a brief howto for using the Babeltrace with LTTng live protocol.
LTTng live allows the user to read a trace while it is running.

In order to create a live LTTng session, please refer to the LTTng
documentation (version >= 2.4).

Once the session is created and Babeltrace is installed, you can list the
sessions with :
$ babeltrace -i lttng-live net://<your-relayd-hostname>

The output should look like this :
net://localhost/host/myhostname/mysessionname (timer = 1000000, 5 stream(s), 0 client(s) connected)

It means that the session mysessionname on the host myhostname is currently
streaming its data to the relayd on localhost.

To attach to this session and start receiving the trace :
$ babeltrace -i lttng-live net://localhost/host/myhostname/mysessionname

You should now see trace data flowing in your console when events are produced.

To report bugs, please use the same procedure as reporting bugs to Babeltrace,
but don't forget to add the -v to the commands above to provide enough debug
information.
