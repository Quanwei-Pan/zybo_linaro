OProfile provides a low-overhead profiler (operf) capable of both
single-application profiling and system-wide profiling.  There is
also a simple event counting tool (ocount).

You can find some documentation in the doc/ directory.

and Philippe Elie <phil.el@wanadoo.fr>.  The operf and ocount
tools were developed by Maynard Johnson <maynardj@us.ibm.com>, who
is the current maintainer.
